## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Deployment Issue
The application is currently facing a critical deployment issue with the backend server:

### Backend Deployment Problem:
- The Node.js/Express backend server fails to deploy properly to hosting platforms.
- This prevents the application from making successful API calls to the FatSecret Platform.
- The frontend cannot communicate with the backend in the production environment.

### Impact:
- Recipe search functionality is non-operational in production.
- Users cannot access recipe details or nutritional information.
- The application is limited to static content only.

## Running the Project Locally
Due to the deployment issue, we recommend running the application locally. Follow these steps:

### Installation and Setup 
I have hardcoded the counsumer key and all.....

3. **Run the server**
   ```sh
   node server.js
   ```
4. **Now run the frontend:**
    Run the the index.html with Live server

### Development Requirements
- **Node.js** v14 or higher.
- **npm** v6 or higher.
- **FatSecret API credentials** (obtain from [FatSecret Platform API](https://platform.fatsecret.com/)).

## Deployment Troubleshooting Guide
To resolve the backend deployment issue:

### Dependencies:
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in `package.json`.
- Check if any dependencies require additional platform configurations.
- Verify that the Node.js and npm versions are compatible with the hosting platform.
